# Concept Scouting — static site

This folder is ready to deploy on Vercel.

## Files
- `index.html` — the site
- `styles.css` — styles
- `assets/` — optional images

## How to put it live (no code)
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `concept-scouting`.
2. Upload the **contents** of this folder to that repo (not the zip itself).
3. In Vercel: New Project → Import your `concept-scouting` repo → Deploy.
4. You get a live URL. Add your domain in Project → Settings → Domains.

Contact form uses Formspree. Replace the `action` URL in `index.html` with your own if you want. Visit https://formspree.io to create one.
